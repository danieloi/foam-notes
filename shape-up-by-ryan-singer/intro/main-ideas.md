# Main Ideas in this Book

## Six-week cycles

First, we work in `six-week cycles`. Six weeks is long enough to build something meaningful start-to-finish and short enough that everyone can feel the deadline looming from the start, so they use the time wisely. The majority of our new features are built and released in one six-week cycle.

Our decisions are based on moving the product forward in the next six weeks, not micromanaging time. We don’t count hours or question how individual days are spent. We don’t have daily meetings. We don’t rethink our roadmap every two weeks. Our focus is at a higher level. We say to ourselves: “If this project ships after six weeks, we’ll be really happy. We’ll feel our time was well spent.” Then we commit the six weeks and leave the team alone to get it done.

## Shaping the work

Second, we shape the work before giving it to a team. A small senior group works in parallel to the cycle teams. They define the key elements of a solution before we consider a project ready to bet on. Projects are defined at the right level of abstraction: concrete enough that the teams know what to do, yet abstract enough that they have room to work out the interesting details themselves.

When shaping, we focus less on estimates and more on our `appetite`. Instead of asking how much time it will take to do some work, we ask: How much time do we want to spend? How much is this idea worth? This is the task of shaping: narrowing down the problem and designing the outline of a solution that fits within the constraints of our appetite. [[steps-to-shaping]]

## Making teams responsible

Third, we give full responsibility to a small integrated team of designers and programmers.

- They define their own tasks,
- make adjustments to the scope,
- and work together to build vertical slices of the product one at a time.

This is completely different from other methodologies, where managers chop up the work and programmers act like ticket-takers.

Together, these concepts form a virtuous circle. When teams are more autonomous, senior people can spend less time managing them. With less time spent on management, senior people can shape up better projects. When projects are better shaped, teams have clearer boundaries and so can work more autonomously.

## Targeting risk

`At every step of the process we target a specific risk:the risk of not shipping on time`. This book isn’t about the risk of building the wrong thing. Other books can help you with that (we recommend "Competing Against Luck"). Improving your discovery process should come after regaining your ability to ship. You can have the best strategy in the world, but if you can’t act on it, what good does it do?

This book is about the risk of getting stuck, the risk of getting bogged down with last quarter’s work, wasting time on unexpected problems, and not being free to do what you want to do tomorrow.

`We reduce risk in the shaping process` by solving open questions before we commit the project to a time box. We don’t give a project to a team that still has rabbit holes or tangled interdependencies.

`We reduce risk in the planning (betting) process` by capping our bets to six weeks. If a project runs over, by default it doesn’t get an extension. This “circuit breaker” ensures that we don’t invest multiples of the original appetite on a concept that needs rethinking first.

And lastly `we reduce risk in the building process` by integrating design and programming early. Instead of building lots of disconnected parts and hoping they’ll fit together in the 11th hour, we build one meaningful piece of the work end-to-end early on and then repeat. The team sequences the work from the most unknown to the least worrisome pieces and learns what works and what doesn’t by integrating as soon as possible.

## How this book is organized

Part One is all about **Shaping** — the pre-work we do on projects before we consider them ready to schedule. Each chapter explains a specific step of the process, from setting the appetite on a raw idea, to sketching out a solution, to writing a pitch that presents the potential project. Along the way you’ll learn specific techniques — like breadboarding and fat-marker sketching — to keep the design at the right level of abstraction.

Part Two is about **Betting** — how we choose among the pitched projects and decide what to do six weeks at a time.

Part Three is about **Building** — the expectations we place on the teams and the special practices they use to discover what to do. We’ll look at how the teams figure out what to do, how they integrate design and programming, how they track what’s known versus unknown, and finally how they make the hard calls to finish the project on time.

Lastly the Appendix gives you some help for when it’s time to make changes at your company. There’s some advice on how to try your first six-week experiment, tips on adjusting the methods to your company’s size, and specific guidance for how to implement Shape Up using Basecamp.
